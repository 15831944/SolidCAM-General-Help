  <h1>SolidCAM LicenseÂ </h1>
  <p>To prevent the unauthorized access to the software, SolidCAM is using software licensing or a hardware protection key, the plug-in device that enables the software authentication. SolidCAM hardware keys are available both for USB and LPT ports to support both standalone and network usage.</p>
  <p>To view the information about the license you are using, from the SOLIDWORKS Menu Bar, click <strong>Tools</strong> to access the <strong>SolidCAM</strong> main menu and then choose <strong>License info</strong> or click the corresponding button on the <strong>SolidCAM Part</strong> tab of the SOLIDWORKS <strong>CommandManager</strong>.</p>
  <p>The License Info dialog box is displayed.</p>

  <h3>Key type</h3>
  <p>This section displays the following types of the key:</p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li><strong>Standalone</strong> hardware key enables you to run SolidCAM only on one computer where the key is installed.</li>
    <li><strong>Network</strong> hardware key enables you to run SolidCAM simultaneously on several computers connected to a local area network. There are two types of network hardware keys: non-configurable and configurable. A <strong>Non-configurable</strong> hardware key enables you to use the same set of available SolidCAM modules for all SolidCAM network users. A Configurable hardware key enables you to choose a specific set of modules for each SolidCAM network user.</li>
    <li><strong>Software license</strong> enables you to run SolidCAM only on one computer where the software license is activated.</li>
    <li><strong>Network pool</strong> key works similar to the Network hardware key, with the exception of using a software license.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial mode</strong> key enables you to run SolidCAM as a trial version for a 30-day period of time.</li>
